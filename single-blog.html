                        David Airey is a graphic designer, writer, and consultant, hired by clients of all sizes, from multinationals to companies of one. Since opening his studio in 2005 he has created logos and visual identities for brands in more than 30 countries. The pages of his design blogs (Logo Design Love & Identity Designed) are visited millions of times each year. The Logo Design Love book has sold more than 50,000 copies in English, is available in twelve languages, and is included in the reading lists of design programs around the world. The Identity Designed book? was published in 2019, and in the words of Adobe’s principal designer, Khoi Vinh, it’s, “Not just beautifully designed, but also beautiful in its depth and detail about the identity design process.”</p>
                        
                    <p> His advice: I'm asked time and again where I find the inspiration to do my job, or how I stay inspired, but what we do, as designers, doesn’t need inspiration in the true sense of the word. Design inspiration is a bit of a cliché. The ability to successfully complete project after project comes from study, practice, and experience, as well as following a clearly defined set of steps. In the words of Chuck Close, “Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us just show up and get to work.”</p>
